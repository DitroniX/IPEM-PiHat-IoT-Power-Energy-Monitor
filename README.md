**IPEM PiHat and IPEM PiHat Lite | ATM90E36 IoT Power Energy Monitor SDK**

 - **Super exciting news that my first [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ditronix/ipem-raspberry-pihat-iot-atm90-mains-power-energy-monitor) project has been fully funded - so thank you all for your support.** 
 - [**Please feel free to take a moment and check it out!**]([url](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ditronix/ipem-raspberry-pihat-iot-atm90-mains-power-energy-monitor))

Based on the popular https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEM-IoT-Power-Energy-Monitor, the **IPEM PiHat** takes both IPEC and IPEM to another level via the Raspberry Pi.

[![KickStarter](https://github.com/DitroniX/DitroniX/blob/main/Files/KickStarter-SupportUs.png 'KickStarter')](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ditronix/ipem-raspberry-pihat-iot-atm90-mains-power-energy-monitor?ref=3vw3ge)

**These main GitHub pages and accompanying [Wiki](https://github.com/DitroniX/IPEM-PiHat-IoT-Power-Energy-Monitor/wiki) pages are being updated to include details of the production version of IPEM PiHat and PiHat Lite.**

**NOTE:** These boards have been put into production, fulfillment will be first made to KickStarter Pledges, then they will immediately be made available on [eBay] (https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_saslop=1&_ssn=ditronixuk&_dmd=2).  See updates below for timeline.

## Updates:

 - 25-04-08 - Boards Tested and pleased to sahre, that they are now being shipped to all Kickstarter backers.  
 - 25-04-02 - Production boards (Both Variants), in Production QA.  Delivery to me by early next week.  Final Check on Production boards upon arrival and then shipping to KickStarter Backers! Then added to eBay. Excellent.
 - 25-03-26 - Preproduction testing complete and Production boards (Both Variants), ordered.
 - 25-03-21 - Excellent news in that testing is almost complete.  This is a range of comprehensive testing of the both boards, various electrical testing and safety compliance.  Taken a few days longer than planned but all is good.  Production still planned for this month.
 - 25-03-14 - Testing the Preproduction boards. See this [YouTube Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOppCA2oIU&ab_channel=DitroniX)
 - 25-03-11 - Preproduction boards have arrived and now going through testing, with updates to Wiki on-route.

   Preproduction boards can then be ordered/tested.
 - 25-02-14 - Preproduction IPEM PiHat and IPEM PiHat Lite boards are
   being ordered.
 - 25-02-05 - Example 3D renders of pre-production boards. Comparison
   Chart. 
 - 25-02-02 - Work now continues in supporting documentation, Wiki and
   software examples code.
 - 25-01-23 - Pre-production schematics have been finalised and the
   boards routed.
 - 25-01-17 - Collated feedback. Finalise Pre-production design of both IPEM
   PiHat and IPEM PiHat Lite.

As we steam ahead to production, just wanted to share some photos of the final pre-production version of the two great looking boards.

## Notable visual changes from original Beta which was shown on KickStarter.  These changes took constructive feedback, which helps users to get even more from the boards.

-   Improved layout
-   GPIO Expander
-   DIL Switches added to speed up configuration
-   Accurate RTC DS3231, with Battery Backup (CR2032) connection
-   Switchable Rogowski Inputs and filtering
-   LDO regulator to provide isolated 3V3 to each stacked board
-   Swapped DAC and ADC for improved SN ratio
-   Type C 5V DC input on PiHat Lite. This feeds into the two Raspberry Pi 5V GPIO Pins, so allowing you to power the whole system (single boards, or stacked), via Type C.

You can see the two boards and get an update on my [YouTube Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpOppCA2oIU&ab_channel=DitroniX)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Board Addressing**
   
The IPEM board uses SPI as a means of data communication, with an I2C expander to provide individual GPIO functionality to each ATM90E36.

Following design thoughts prior to finalising the production board, the following improvements have been added.

Change from OneWire to using a two wire I2C Expander. This provides 64 individual addresses, so essentially 64 stacked IPEM's (although this is theoretical).

The design improvement is a much more sensible route as you now assign a fixed address to each board using a DIP switch. This also makes it so much easier is field and with software support and configuration.

The unique design will allow up to a max of:

* 1 x IPEM PiHat + 63 x IPEM PiHat Lite's

or

* 64 x IPEM PiHat Lite's
   
 **CT Clamps and Rogowski Current Transformer**
 
The original IPEM design provided for using the  YHDC SCT-013 100A-50mA.

The updated IPEM PiHat and IPEM PiHat Lite production design, now allows for either use of CT Clamps, and/or Rogowski Current Transformers.  This allows for a wider spectrum of current ranges and cable sizes to be monitored.

 - CT Clamps are the main stream safe and easy method to monitor currents from the mains tails or consumer unit circuits.
   
 - Rogowski Current Transformers are typically for very high currents, or specialised current monitoring.

IPEM Raspberry Pi PiHat ATM90E36 Energy Monitor 

The IPEM Raspberry Pi PiHat ATM90E36 IoT Power Energy Monitor SDK contains all of the IPEM (ESP32) functionality and includes the ATM90E36.  It then adds the ADC and DAC functionality of IPEC and IPEX (ESP32) boards.

The ATM90E36 contains all of the ATM90E32 functions plus additional functionality, and so will be the main release.

 - Multiple Single Phases.  (Different circuits or home/office rings, Inverters etc.) 
 - Dual Phase (2 x Live -Typically for USA.  i.e. 2 x 110V) 
 - Three Phase Star (3 x Live and 1 x Neutral) 
 - Three Phase Delta (3 x Live)
